/* 

Function:
A function in JavaScript is like a recipe that you can use over and over again to perform a specific task.

Purpose:
Functions help you organize your code and make it easier to manage and reuse. Instead of writing the same code multiple times, you create a function and then call (use) that function whenever you need to perform that task.
